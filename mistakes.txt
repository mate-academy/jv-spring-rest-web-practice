    Continue working on Spring MVC. Implement the following functionality.

    OrderController
    + Complete order - POST: /orders/complete?userId
    + Get orders history for user - GET: /orders?userId
    AuthenticationController
    + Register - POST: /register
    UserController
    + Get user by email - GET: /users/by-email?email
    ShoppingCartController
    Add movie session - PUT: /shopping-carts/movie-sessions?userId&movieSessionId
    Get by user - GET: /shopping-carts/by-user?userId
    We will remove userId from request parameters in the future.

    ! Don't create GlobalExceptionHandler, custom validation annotations in this HW (this is not specified in the task condition)

    + In order to properly use new dependencies in your project, you might need to run mvn clean package.
    + Make your code consistent. Use the @Autowired annotation everywhere with the constructors or delete it from everywhere.
    + Return id of entity in all response DTOs.
    + Remember about REST resource-naming convention.
    + In your mappers prefer setters over big constructors while converting entity to dto and vice versa.
    + Use Stream API while working with lists in your mappers.
    In your MovieSessionRequest/ResponseDtos, we don’t need to pass the whole information about
    Movie and CinemaHall - their ids will be enough.
    When creating a MovieSession, if you need to accept LocalDateTime in request body -
    add jackson-datatype-jsr310 dependency to be able to parse it into MovieSessionRequestDto.
    Your method names in controllers and mappers should have uniform names.
    Be attentive with ShoppingCartController. We should use PUT HTTP, not POST when adding a movie session.
    Don’t create redundant dtos and mappers for them.
    What do we need to use in AuthenticationController to create User: UserService or AuthenticationService?

    + Be careful which mapping should be class-level and which method-level:

     Wrong:
        @RestController
        @RequestMapping("/register")
        public class AuthenticationController {
            private final AuthenticationService service;

            @PostMapping
            public void registration(@RequestBody UserRequestDto requestDto) {
                service.register(requestDto.getEmail(), requestDto.getPassword());
            }
        }

     + Good:
        @RestController
        public class AuthenticationController {
            private final AuthenticationService service;

            @PostMapping("/register")
            public void registration(@RequestBody UserRequestDto requestDto) {
                service.register(requestDto.getEmail(), requestDto.getPassword());
            }
            /*
              We may have method with @PostMapping("/login") too.
              So it's incorrect to add /register as class-level mapping.
            */
        }

    You can return information about tickets in your ShoppingCartResponseDto / OrderResponseDto in the form of List<Long> tiketIds.
    When choosing the fields to be returned in your ShoppingCartResponseDto, keep in mind that cartId and userId hold the same value.
    Don’t expose secure data in your ResponseDtos.
    Use DtoRequestMapper and DtoResponseMapper as types when you declare mapper fields in controllers.
